    Initially, Benjamin signed to Columbia Records, while still being enrolled at USC.[8] However, Columbia Records ended their partnership before he was able to submit his album.[9] Despite this, he used other methods to gain a following: he performed his songs in parking lots outside of concert venues and handed out business cards to promote his work.[9]
    Benjamin's song "I Built a Friend" was used as backing material for a contemporary dance audition in the 12th season of America's Got Talent (May 30, 2017).
    Benjamin's mixtape Narrated For You reached number 127 on the US Billboard 200 in 2019. The mixtape features the songs "Water Fountain" and "Let Me Down Slowly", which was released as a single with Alessia Cara.[10]
    Benjamin has created "Can I Sing For You?" videos on YouTube in which he performs his written songs in acoustic to people in public.[11] In 2019, he recorded two singles with Spotify Studios NYC, one of which was a cover of Eminem's "Stan".[12]
    Benjamin's debut album These Two Windows was released on May 29, 2020. The album reached number 75 on the US Billboard 200.
